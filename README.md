<h1>Berthe Morisot Art Tour Holidays</h1>
My project is the website for a fictious holiday company called Berthe Morisot Art Tour Holidays(the name chosen for no other reason than Berthe Morisot is one of my favourite female artists). The website contains information on the hotels, tourist attractions, museums, and cafes in any city that a user clicks on from a list of countries.
<h2>UX</h2>
This website is for someone looking to plan different aspects of their holiday in their chosen city , with particular reference to hotels, museums, tourist attractions, art galleries .and cafes.

The user clicks on the country autocomplete search bar, and clicks on an option from the dropdown list of countries.
<h3> To select a city</h3>
The user clicks on the enter a city search bar, and begins to type a name, or enough of a name , and then can click on one of the options from the dropdown menu that appears with suggestions of cities within the country choosen whoose names begin with the first letter typed.

When a country, city, and option is selected, e.g. hotels, the autocomplete search will drop down markers on he map to show the location of the various hotels in that city. Each marker has an alphabetical letter to identify it in the  results table below. Double clicking on the marker on the map will give a dropdown listing the name, address, telephone number, and rating of the hotel. The same is true if art galleries, museums,cafes , or tourist attractions are choosen by the user. The name, address. telephone and rating of a hotel can also be displayed by clik=cking on an the alphabetical marker in the table of results and wiill appear over the marker on the map.
